# OMORI-Android

## IMPORTANT: THIS ONLY WORKS FOR OMORI 1.0.0 !!

Note: The game runs terribly. I won't be doing anything to fix that -- this is just a proof-of-concept.

This repository contains the files needed to run OMORI on an Android phone (minimum API level is 30).

It doesn't patch any files of the game, only adding new ones.

## How to install

1) Download the repository and extract it somewhere.
2) Open the file under "www/browser_ver/config.js" and follow the instructions inside.
3) Take the "www" folder of your OMORI 1.0.0 install and copy it to /sdcard (should be called "\Internal storage" or something on Windows)
4) Rename the copy to "OMORI" (all caps)
5) Take the contents of the "www" folder you just downloaded and put them inside of the "OMORI" folder that you just created. Click "yes" if prompted to merge folders.
6) Move the APK to your phone and install it.

This should be enough to have the game work. Please report any bugs under the Issues tab!
